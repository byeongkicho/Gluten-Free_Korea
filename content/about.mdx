# About GF Korea

Helping the gluten-free community navigate Korea safely.

## Why I Started This Website

After moving back to Korea, I realized how difficult it is to find safe gluten-free food, especially for people like my wife who has celiac disease.

Even restaurants that claim to offer gluten-free bread sometimes use wheat flour blends. I've spent a lot of time researching and verifying safe restaurants in Seoul and across Korea, and I want to share those tips to help others stay safe.
