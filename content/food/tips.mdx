# Tips for Eating Gluten-Free in Korea

- Ask: '밀가루 들어갔나요?' (Does this contain flour?)
- Request: '간장 대신 소금으로 해주세요.' (Please use salt instead of soy sauce.)
- Plain rice, grilled meats (구이), and steamed dishes are generally safe.
- Watch for hidden gluten in soups/stews and marinated dishes.
- Look for '글루텐프리' labels. Imported items often have English labels too.
- Carry a dining card explaining celiac/gluten intolerance in Korean.
- Street foods often use batter; choose roasted nuts, fruits, or skewers instead.
- When in doubt, choose simple dishes with minimal sauces.
