# Guides (MDX)

This folder contains long-form SEO guides written in MDX.

Suggested workflow:

- Write a new guide as `content/guides/<slug>.mdx`
- Include `export const metadata = { title, description, date, updated, tags }`
- Keep content practical and safety-first.

When ready, we will wire these guides into a route (e.g. `/guides/<slug>`).
