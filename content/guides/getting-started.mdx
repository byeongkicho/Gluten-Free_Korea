# Gluten-Free in Korea: Getting Started (2026)

If you are visiting Korea (or living here) with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, the hardest part is not finding food. It is finding **confidence**.

This guide is a practical, safety-first starting point. It is not medical advice. When in doubt, prioritize safety.

## Quick answer (30 seconds)

- Learn the highest-risk items in Korea: **soy sauce**, **gochujang**, **ramyeon**, **fried foods**, **marinades**, and **shared grills**.
- Use a dining card (Korean phrases) and ask about **cross-contamination**.
- Prefer simple foods: grilled meat + plain rice + fresh sides (confirm sauces).
- When unsure, choose packaged foods with clear allergen labeling.
- Start with a small shortlist you trust:
  - Food guide: `/food`
  - Dining directory: `/dining`
  - Recommended products: `/shop`

## What to say (simple Korean phrases)

Use these short phrases first, then ask follow-ups.

- "    " (I have celiac / gluten sensitivity.)
  - Korean:    
  - Romanization: *jeo-neun geul-loo-ten-e dae-han min-gam-jeung-i iss-eo-yo*
  - English: I am sensitive to gluten.

- " ?" (Does this contain wheat flour / soy sauce?)
  - Korean:   ?
  - Romanization: *mil-ga-ru-na gan-jang-i deul-eo-ga-yo?*
  - English: Does it include wheat flour or soy sauce?

Note: We will add a full printable dining card guide in a separate page.

## The biggest hidden risk: sauces and marinades

Many Korean dishes are naturally rice-based, but the flavor often comes from sauces that may contain wheat.

High-risk items to always ask about:

- Soy sauce (ganjang, )
- Gochujang ()
- Doenjang () and ssamjang ()
- Marinades for bulgogi/galbi
- Fried batter and shared frying oil

## Cross-contamination: what to ask

If you are strict celiac, you need more than ingredients.

Ask these questions:

- Can you use a clean pan and clean utensils?
- Is the grill shared? (shared grills are high risk)
- Is the fryer shared?
- Are noodles cooked in shared water?
- Are sauces brushed on with shared brushes?

## Safe-ish meal patterns (when you need something now)

These are patterns that can be safer, but still require questions.

- Plain rice + simple grilled protein + fresh vegetables (no sauce)
- Bibimbap without gochujang (bring your own safe sauce later)
- Sashimi-style meals (watch soy sauce)
- Packaged snacks labeled gluten-free (verify)

## Convenience stores and supermarkets

Packaged foods can be safer if labeling is clear.

Tips:

- Check for wheat/barley/rye and for soy sauce ingredients.
- Prefer single-ingredient foods (plain nuts, plain yogurt, fruit, eggs).
- If the label is unclear, skip.
